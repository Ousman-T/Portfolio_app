Portfolio Project Built using React 

All files were created with the .jsx tag rather than .js 

Styled the project using basic CSS. Each Component has it's own correlating CSS file. 

Implemented Routing to allow navigation throughout the App. 

Used material-ui to render logos and icons. 
Also had to force material-ui to install due to deprecation

Faced a few challenges with this project, mainly CSS driven.

Very proud of my Footer and NavBar.

Experiences page was really fun to work on and structure. 


Implemented a vertical timeline to the Experience.jsx file in order to show work/school experience

Planning to implement a feature for people to message me directly or email

Need to touch up on some styling. 

Had a great time giving logos and icons functionality, learning to work with props, router, and useEffect hands on was pretty eye opening.

API chosen was one for quotes. Large array of quotes. Wrote a function to return one random quote on every refresh/site visit.
